# How does SSE work?


# Use cases:
- live updates, for dashboards and progress bars
- live sports scores
- market data updates

# Advantages over websockets:
- Simplicity of implementation
- Less overhead compared to ws, more efficient
- Native support by modern browsers (not really an advantage over ws)
